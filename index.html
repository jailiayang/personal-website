                    Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Jailia (pronounced juh-LAY-uh), </br>
                    and I'm super excited to have you here! </br> </br>

                    I am a third-year undergraduate student at Stanford Universiy majoring in Computer Science </br>
                    with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction and a minor in Ethics and Technology. </br>
                    I am passionate about technology and its growing use in our digitizing world. Throughout my </br>
                    career, I hope to answer questions like how can we implement equitable algorithms? how does </br>
                    technology affect groups differently? and where do we draw the line with technological solutionism? </br> </br>
                    
                    I am also deeply interested in Asian American studies and Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality studies, </br>
                    as well as community organizing and advocating for marginalized and underrepresented groups. I look </br>
                    forward to further exploring these areas of interest and their intersections with technology.

                                During my time as a Technical Research Assistant at the Stanford Internet Observatory, I actively participated 
                                in research efforts aimed at the Journal of Online Trust and Safety by writing multiple Python and command line scripts.
                                A significant highlight of my role involved pushing the boundaries of election misinformation research. This entailed
                                creating a Python command line script capable of efficiently scraping content from over 50 Telegram channels. 
                                This initiative not only contributed to fostering greater awareness about election-related issues and propagandistic 
                                materials but also showcased my dedication to educational endeavors.

                                During my internship with Siemens on the Energy Management Software (EMS) team, I contributed significantly 
                                to the optimization of operational workflows. One of my key achievements was successfully transitioning a 
                                Python interface to PL/SQL scripts, resulting in a seamless process that greatly improved task efficiency and 
                                execution. In addition, I played a pioneering role in a transformative business project that involved the 
                                development of a PL/SQL package. This package was instrumental in enabling flexible migration of internal model 
                                schemas, ultimately enhancing our data management capabilities to a new level. </br> </br>

                                My dedication and skills were recognized when I secured first place in an intern programming challenge among my
                                business unit. As a proficient Python developer, I skillfully utilized various libraries, including Streamlit, 
                                to craft a sophisticated data visualization-driven application. The application was designed for predictive 
                                generation forecasting, showcasing my ability to deliver innovative solutions in a professional and timely manner.

                                As I interned alongside the National Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) at RSM US LLP, I played a pivotal 
                                role in bolstering cybersecurity response capabilities. One of my key contributions involved streamlining and 
                                enhancing threat intelligence workflows. I harnessed the power of Docanno to meticulously annotate an extensive 
                                collection of over 12,000 MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Leveraging my skills in scripting and data analysis,
                                I successfully consolidated this vast dataset onto a unified platform. </br> </br>

                                Additionally, I undertook the ambitious task of creating a quantitative risk index with a global scope. By analyzing
                                over 100 countries using well-defined criteria, I initiated the foundation of this index. To gather the necessary
                                data, I employed web scraping techniques and thoroughly examined over 15 websites. The culmination of these efforts 
                                resulted in the development of a dynamic data visualization tool, effectively displaying risk ratings and outcomes. 
                                This comprehensive approach allowed for a more informed understanding of risk landscapes, providing valuable insights
                                for strategic decision-making.
